# Wayfinder Map: Complete Fight AccessControl consumer adoption

**Label:** `wayfinder:map`
**Status:** Active

> This map is an **index, not a store**. Each material decision lives in exactly one linked ticket under
> `tickets/`; this map summarizes linked resolution and points to one next decision frontier.

## Destination

Give Fight Agent OS a decision-complete route to account for supported Fight AccessControl use cases as an
**authorized, evidence-backed consumer**: human-facing management where appropriate, protected operational
paths for sensitive effects, a fully qualified Agent credential/operation integration, and a versioned Agent
OS-owned reference handoff for five managed starter maintainers. “Complete” means every relevant current public
capability has an owned usable integration or a human-approved explicit non-UI/exclusion disposition; it does
**not** mean one endpoint per method, a general secret console, package v1.0.0, or starter implementation.

**Done** = [WF-032](tickets/WF-032-reconcile-accesscontrol-coverage-and-accepted-scope.md) through
[WF-034](tickets/WF-034-set-reference-consumer-and-starter-handoff-contract.md) are resolved or explicitly
excluded with maintainer approval; ownership/amendment paths for conflicts are recorded; the
[capability matrix](research/WF-032-accesscontrol-consumer-capability-matrix.md) identifies gaps and proposed
surfaces; and an approved next bounded EPIC destination is linked. Done is **planning handoff**, not live
AccessControl adoption, actual Agent qualification, starter certification, production enrollment or release.

## Notes

### Established facts (not new approval)

- Static inspection of current Agent OS `develop` `7002441` and installed `fight-access-control` **v0.5.0** at
  `46ffcf75f1e14dbc5b58a5049e05a600ce5cf8a0` is recorded in the
  [traceable package → consumer → owner → gap matrix](research/WF-032-accesscontrol-consumer-capability-matrix.md).
  The branch initially adds only a separate committed README scope update. The package's full v0.5.0 Agent
  operation/cohort, Feature and MCP contracts exceed the current consumer paths. No runtime/source/provider
  qualification was executed for this map. Package tests, repository injection, and a storage-only
  `AgentRepository` are not proof of live Agent authority.
- The installed `PostgresAgentRepository` supplies ordinary storage and direct Permission/reference protection
  but rejects `getOperationContract()` with `UNAVAILABLE`. No `AgentOperationRepository`, persisted cohort,
  protected sink, independent restore witness or Agent authentication/worker is installed. [TASK-00126](../tasks/00126-TASK.md)
  accepted this **limited** boundary, not complete Agent use. The only API-v1 Actions currently registered are
  CSRF bootstrap and public-safe validation metadata; the React shell is non-product. Credential-delivery/expiry
  console paths serve **human** grants with a null local/test delivery provider, not Agent issuance or a production
  enrollment. Feature storage/reference checks do not constitute Feature scanning, runtime enforcement or UI.
- [EPIC-00004](../epics/00004-EPIC.md) explicitly defers email-address change and broad profile mutation,
  although [TICKET-00030](../tickets/00030-TICKET.md)/[TICKET-00031](../tickets/00031-TICKET.md) now own
  specific user/session/role administration; changing the deferral needs the decision owner, not a planning
  index edit. [EPIC-00006](../epics/00006-EPIC.md) promises managed identities, direct Permissions and Harness
  credential isolation, but its TICKET-00034 templates and presentation/terminal work do not already own every
  v0.5.0 operation/cohort/delivery/recovery proof. [EPIC-00009](../epics/00009-EPIC.md) owns project creation
  and the five managed starter *catalog entries*, not starter-source adoption or release.
- [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-application-ownership-and-orchestration.md) assigns package Domain/Application authority
  to AccessControl and transport, persistence, provider and demonstrated cross-boundary orchestration to Agent
  OS. [ADR 0002](../adr/0002-postgresql-consistency-and-durable-effects.md) requires a shared PostgreSQL
  transaction and package-owned durable state, and historically deferred Agent authority. A newly approved
  Agent adoption must explicitly update/supplement that deferred boundary using the actual locked contract,
  without rewriting its accepted historical evidence. The [closed vision map](complete-agent-os-vision-map.md)
  supplies accepted Repository/Harness/Runner direction and remains closed.
- The five starter handoff recipients are `johnnickell/project-symfony`, `project-slim`, `project-laravel`,
  `project-yii`, and `project-codeigniter`. EPIC-00009 already permits **each individual** eligible managed
  starter to be offered after its own immutable stable SemVer release `>=1.0.0`, required generation manifest
  and verified snapshot. No all-five prerequisite or AccessControl 1.0.0 gate is introduced here.

### Proposed routing and EPIC handoff (subject to decisions)

Human browser surfaces: authorized user/role/session/invitation management as planned; **approved in WF-032**:
self-service and authorized cross-user email-change request/cancel with mailbox confirmation and a Super Admin
Feature Flags screen for safe listing, immutable-name creation, testing Permission selection/rebinding, OFF/PREVIEW/ON
and guarded removal. Feature management has a separate `ADMIN_SAFE` Permission initially granted only to
`ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`; cross-user email management has a distinct `SUPER_ADMIN_ONLY` Permission. Operational
console/worker surfaces: bootstrap, managed-policy preview/reconcile where necessary, Agent credentials,
sink/receipt/recovery/maintenance, key/cohort/restore operations and Feature discovery/provisioning/preparation.
Explicit non-UI: raw material, claim/lease, nonce, key destruction, background expiry/cleanup and other privileged
worker internals. Every path needs fresh server-side actor/target/delegation and exact Permission authority, safe
projections, bounded effects and transaction/recovery evidence; neither a UI nor an HMAC signature grants ongoing
authorization. Registered checks, current-code retirement evidence and separate action authorization must qualify
Feature activation and removal; no fake Feature is needed to render the screen.

**Next bounded EPIC destination after decisions:** qualify one *real* AccessControl Agent credential and operation
journey for a managed Harness Agent through issuance → protected delivery → authenticated use → rotation/revocation
→ restart/restore recovery, with safe admin intents/status and direct Permission policy. Recommend a separate
linked EPIC rather than silently enlarging EPIC-00006's accepted Planning/terminal scope; record an EPIC-00006
owner-approved amendment/cross-reference if needed. WF-032 approved **two other separate new EPIC destinations**:
a deferred human email-change journey and a Feature Flags management/runtime lifecycle, both linked to
EPIC-00004's authentication/authorization foundation.
They explicitly extend its historical deferral without rewriting EPIC-00004 or TICKET-00030/00031. WF-034 still
owns whether evidence-backed starter handoff needs another separate destination. Do not grill an EPIC before
WF-033/WF-034 finish or descend to TICKET/TASK planning.

## Decisions so far

1. **[WF-032 — Reconcile AccessControl coverage with accepted Agent OS scope](tickets/WF-032-reconcile-accesscontrol-coverage-and-accepted-scope.md) is closed.** Self-service and Super Admin cross-user email-change request/cancel with mailbox confirmation, distinct protected management Permission, and Super Admin Feature Flags management (immutable-name creation, testing Permission, OFF/PREVIEW/ON, guarded removal) with initially Super Admin-granted `ADMIN_SAFE` management Permission are approved. Two separate linked new EPIC destinations explicitly extend EPIC-00004's deferred scope; sensitive operational paths are protected non-UI, unsupported features are not invented.
2. **[WF-033 — Define live Agent operation adoption and safe surfaces](tickets/WF-033-define-agent-operation-adoption-boundary.md) is open.** Decide one qualified managed Agent use proof, surface split and EPIC-00006 ownership after WF-032.
3. **[WF-034 — Set the Agent OS reference-consumer and starter handoff contract](tickets/WF-034-set-reference-consumer-and-starter-handoff-contract.md) is open.** Decide versioned evidence and Agent OS-only starter handoff after coverage and Agent criteria are settled.

## Blocking relationships

```text
WF-032 (coverage and accepted-scope owner) → WF-033 (Agent adoption and surface)
                                    WF-032 + WF-033 → WF-034 (reference handoff)
WF-032 + WF-033 + WF-034 → approved bounded EPIC handoff(s)
```

## Frontier

[WF-033 — Define live Agent operation adoption and safe surfaces](tickets/WF-033-define-agent-operation-adoption-boundary.md)
is the next unblocked decision. **Recommendation:** qualify one real managed Agent issuance → protected delivery →
authenticated use → rotation/revocation → recovery journey on the full v0.5.0 operation/cohort contract before
live enablement, and decide whether to link a new Agent EPIC or explicitly extend EPIC-00006. WF-032 is closed;
WF-034 remains blocked on WF-033.

## Not yet specified (fog)

- Which real Agent OS Feature declaration/runtime use warrants enablement; the approved screen may have an empty
  state or create OFF definitions without inventing a fake Feature or activating an unregistered runtime check.
- Exact existing/deployed Agent or Feature data outside this repository and the actual protection/restore tools;
  owner inventory and runtime evidence are required before enabling effects, not assumptions from empty local data.
- Exact UI routes, permission IDs, PostgreSQL schema, sink implementation, worker topology and conformance run
  schedule belong to later approved EPIC → TICKET → TASK planning; unverified source/package drift must be
  requalified at implementation.

## Out of scope

No upstream AccessControl API edits, package release/major-version decision, startup migration or credential
issuance; no starter source edits/tests/certification/tags/releases, all-five eligibility gate, product endpoints,
Feature toggling or deployment in this Wayfinder decision; no automatic rewriting of EPIC-00004/00006/00009,
ADR 0001/0002, the closed vision map or pre-existing TASKs. No EPIC creation or TICKET/TASK decomposition in
this decision-resolution pass.
